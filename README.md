# ReactWeek2

Day 1 = Demo-app
Day 2 = Seed Client
I have not been able to deploy my server files so far, but it worked on localHost, so here is a link to the files since GitHub Complains about the size: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8MAEg7fd85QMkJqaGdDOXhMdUU/view?usp=sharing
Day 3 = Facebook-tutoriel (Pretend I spelled Tutorial correct...)
Link to Expo Project https://expo.io/@jonsabban/facebook-tutoriel


Please note that I have removed the modules folder in the projects, install them again before use.
